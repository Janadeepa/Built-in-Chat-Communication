5 . Create Frontend:
    Create a simple HTML file with JavaScript to handle sending and receiving chat messages. Use Socket.IO client library to communicate with the server.
6 . Style Your UI:
    Add CSS to style your chat application and make it more user-friendly.
7 . Testing and Deployment:
    Test your chat application locally, and once you're satisfied, you can deploy it to a hosting service like Heroku.

This is a basic outline to get you started. You'll need to fill in the details, such as defining Mongoose schemas, implementing routes, creating the frontend, and adding authentication if necessary.
Additionally, you can expand upon this foundation by adding features like user authentication, private messaging, message persistence, etc.
